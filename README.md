This repo contains the Ansible templates that DeployHub Ansible Playbook Action uses.  The values for the variables come from the DeployHub Component, Application, Environment and End Point attributes.  

The hierarchy of the DeployHub's variable stack enables overrrides of the defaults and promotes the separation of values from code.
